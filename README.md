# Software-Manual-QA-Project
On July 2021, I graduated a 4 month course at Scoala Informala de IT, studying Manual Software Testing.
<br/>
This is my QA project
<br/> 
The project reffers to the manual testing of an e-commerce website
<br/>
-> exploratory testing, test data, wrote & run test cases, reported bugs, test report
